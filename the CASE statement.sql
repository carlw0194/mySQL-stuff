# Use when you want to sepcify different conditions to obtain different kinds of results from each condition applied .This is similar to an if else statement but capable of handling more than one conditional statement.

# Example 1
 /*
 Extract a dataset containing the following information about the managers: employee number, first name, and last name. Add two columns at the end â€“ one showing the difference between the maximum and minimum salary of that employee, and another one saying whether this salary raise was higher than $30,000 or NOT.
